# Chip Factory

Lightweight browser game that turns semiconductor device fabrication into a guided stacking challenge. Built as a single HTML file so you can drop it straight into a portfolio or GitHub Pages site.

## Play locally

Open `chip-factory-game.html` in any modern browser. No build tools or dependencies are required.

## Deploy on GitHub Pages

1. Create (or reuse) a GitHub repository and copy `chip-factory-game.html` into the repository root.
2. From the project folder:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-account>/<your-repo>.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
3. In the GitHub web UI, enable **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Deploy from a branch**, choose the `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder, and save.
4. Your live game will be available at `https://<your-account>.github.io/<your-repo>/chip-factory-game.html`. Share that link on LinkedIn.

## Optional tweaks

- Update the blue header copy in `chip-factory-game.html` to include your name or project blurb.
- Add a screenshot to your README so visitors immediately see the gameplay.
- If you prefer Netlify, drag-and-drop the HTML file into <https://app.netlify.com/drop>; Netlify will give you a public URL instantly.
