## 🤔 What is this?

Ever wondered how your phone's brain is built? Chip Factory is a Tetris-inspired game that simulates the fascinating process of semiconductor manufacturing. Players build different types of computer chips by carefully placing layers in the right positions, just like in a real semiconductor factory!

## ✨ Features

- 🔌 Build three types of chips: Transistors, Memory Cells, and Power Managers
- 🎯 Learn real semiconductor manufacturing concepts while playing
- 💡 Discover interesting facts about computer chip manufacturing
- 🏆 Score points for perfect layer placements
- 📱 Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile
- 🎨 Beautiful, modern UI with smooth animations

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Choose your chip type (Transistor, Memory, or Power)
2. Watch the blueprint on the right to see where layers should go
3. Use arrow keys to move pieces:
   - ←/→ to move left/right
   - ↓ to drop faster
   - Space for instant drop
   - P to pause
4. Match the layer pattern exactly for bonus points!
5. Complete all layers to build a working chip

## 🛠️ Technology

Built with vanilla web technologies:
- HTML5 Canvas for smooth graphics
- Pure CSS for modern UI
- Vanilla JavaScript for game logic
- No external dependencies!

## 🎓 Educational Value

While playing, you'll learn about:
- Semiconductor manufacturing processes
- Different types of computer chips
- Layer-by-layer chip construction
- Real-world chip manufacturing facts
